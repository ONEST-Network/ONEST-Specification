## Introduction

In today's rapidly growing and evolving world, access to quality education and skill development has become a global challenge. Our traditional education system suffers from multiple limitations like financial barriers, geographical limitation, lack of discoverability, portability and high cost of trust verification, leaving individuals with limited opportunities to acquire essential skills. To empower individuals, it is crucial to provide them with the right skills, knowledge, and opportunities to adapt and succeed in an ever-evolving environment.


Additionally, as the technology and industries advance, there is an urgent need to bridge the ever-widening skill gaps in the job market and it demands continuous upskilling and reskilling efforts. The emergence of EdTech has brought promising opportunities, but there are certain challenges faced by them also. These challenges encompass difficulties in reaching the right audience, grappling with the high operational costs associated with platform-led service models, encountering a digital divide based on platform popularity, and struggling to establish trust with users. The inability to effectively address these obstacles hampers the seamless dissemination of services and undermines the overall efficacy of educational platforms.

To address these multifaceted challenges,  a paradigm shift from relying solely on centralized platforms for storing and exchanging value to embracing a decentralized network comprising interconnected ecosystem actors that facilitate the flow of value is necessary . An open network for education and skilling becomes indispensable, striving to bridge the skill gap, provide quality and trustworthy education, leverage EdTech's potential while fostering a collaborative community of learners and educators, thus empowering individuals to thrive in an ever-changing world.

**Open Network for Education Skilling Transaction (ONEST)** fosters a fair and accessible network that is both open and decentralized, allowing individuals and organizations to harness its power to unlock their full potential, facilitating access to learning and livelihood opportunities.
The objective of setting up ONEST is to break the current siloed ecosystem where the education & content providers, education facilitators, education seekers, education facilitators & job providers operate in a fragmented and secluded manner which restricts collaborations that could have otherwise flourished into business & social partnerships aiming towards the same goal of “**equitable education** & **skilling to enhance employability** and **sustainable livelihood**.”  

ONEST will primarily focus on enabling equitable opportunities for education, upskilling & jobs under the following four key categories,

**Learning Experiences: Content, Courses, Training**

ONEST facilitates skilling and upskilling by onboarding education providers and consumers, enabling the broadcast and discovery of courses, content, and training opportunities. It fosters healthy competition, drives innovation, and bridges supply-demand gaps, empowering individuals, organizations, and the Government to address challenges in the competitive job ecosystem effectively.

**Financial Aid: Scholarship, Grants, CSR**

ONEST aims to combat high dropout rates in school and higher education caused by economic factors by collaborating with multilateral and not-for-profit organizations to provide financial aid, scholarships, and grants. By offering a unified user experience, ONEST will enable students and professionals to discover and track their applications for financial support, increasing youth employability and improving job prospects in India. This multifaceted strategy involves schools, educators, families, communities, legislators, and various organizations to address the concerns surrounding dropout rates effectively.

**Work Opportunities: Internship, Jobs, Gigs**

ONEST will forge partnerships with large employment organizations, job portals, and employment agencies to connect job seekers with potential employers, facilitating the discovery of relevant internships and job opportunities for students and professionals. Additionally, it will cater to gig workers, offering them a means to explore project-based or short-term work, addressing the challenge of irregular and unpredictable income by providing a centralized gig discovery platform.

**Expert Connect: Mentorship, Volunteering, and Tutoring**

ONEST will connect learners with experienced mentors, coaches, and tutors, enabling personalized mentorship, coaching, and tutoring based on individual career goals. Utilizing algorithms for suitable mentor matches and a transaction fabric for discovery, booking, and feedback, it can  accelerate career paths, guiding learners towards better professional decisions and growth.
